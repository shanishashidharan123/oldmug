At the same time, the Sun and  wind's harsh effects and the pull of gravity take their toll, resulting in  frown lines <em>(vertical creases between your eyebrows)</em>, wrinkling across your  forehead and heavy, drooping eyebrows. These changes can start when you are in  your 30s, and may make you look angry, sad or even perplexed when you are not.</p>
                        <p>Brow lift surgery can help. A brow lift or forehead lift minimizes the creases  across the forehead and those that occur high on the bridge of the nose. A brow  lift can also vanish frown lines and reposition expression lines and other  telltale signs of aging in your brow region</p>
                        <h2>Gender differences</h2>
                        <p>The male  brow is naturally lower and less arched than that of the female. the  female brow is finer; more curved and is situated above the bony rim.</p>
                        <h3>Frequently asked questions?</h3>
                        <h4>What is the cause of eyebrow ptosis?</h4>
                        <p>Eyebrow  ptosis occurs simply with ageing, due to thinning and descent of the tissue of  the forehead. It can co-exist with true upper eyelid ptosis and true  excess skin on the upper eyelids <em>(dermatochalasis)</em>. Occasionally, eyebrow ptosis is caused by a paralysis of the facial nerve <em>(facial palsy)</em>, or weight  of a tumour, or trauma on one side.</p>
                        <h2>Candidacy</h2>
                        <p>You must have realistic expectations  of what a brow lift can  and can't do for your face and your life. A brow  lift can make you look younger and more relaxed, but it won't make you look  like you are 18 again. It also cannot change any other factor about your life,  nor should you expect it to. Most  brow lift candidates are between the ages of 40 and 65, although some people  opt for less extensive brow lifts while still in their 30s.</p>
                        <p>You must be in good health and not  have any uncontrolled diseases or medical conditions to be considered a  candidate for any cosmetic procedure, including a brow lift.</p>
                        <p>During your initial consultation  appointment, your surgeon will take a complete medical history. Don't hold  anything back. Let your surgeon judge what is and what is not relevant. Include  your family history and your personal disease history as well as any past  surgeries. Make sure that you tell the surgeon about any allergies or past  reactions to anesthesia. If you smoke, tell your surgeon. He or she has tools  that can help you quit smoking for good before your brow lift. You must also  disclose all of the medications you are taking. This includes vitamin or  mineral supplements, herbal products, and over-the-counter medications.</p>
                        <h2>Indications  for eyebrow lift</h2>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Drooping       eyebrows causing a visual field problem.  </li>
                          <li>Fatigue       and headaches at the end of the day because of over-action of the forehead       muscles which raise the eyebrows.</li>
                          <li>Aesthetic/Cosmetic       reasons.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>Getting  ready!</h2>
                        <p>The preoperative  appointment is about a week or so before your actual brow lift surgery. This  visit is another chance to ask questions and get to know your facial plastic  surgeon. A preoperative information packet should explain everything that you  should do and know before your brow lift. The packet should include a list of  all the medications to avoid taking for the one to two weeks before your brow  surgery. These medications will include products containing Aspirin or  Ibuprofen, which increase your risk of bleeding. If you smoke, quit smoking as  far in advance of your surgery as possible. Smoking interferes with circulation  and healing. And besides all the other known health risks associated with  smoking, it also causes premature wrinkling.</p>
                        <p>You will likely need  to have routine blood work to make sure you are healthy enough to have surgery,  and you may also be asked to have a complete physical examination if you are  overdue. These measures will help protect your health and safety.</p>
                        <h2>Brow lift  surgery: muscle memory</h2>
                        <p>Some brow  lift types involve moving, rearranging or shortening the muscles in your  forehead and brow area. There are three main muscles in this part of your face.</p>
                        <p>The  corrugators muscle pulls your eyebrows to the center of your face and downward,  forming vertical wrinkles in the glabellas area <em>(the space between your  eyebrows and above your nose)</em> and horizontal wrinkles at the bridge of your  nose. The frontalis muscle runs from the hairline straight down to your  eyebrows. It draws your eyebrows and the skin of your forehead up, forming  horizontal wrinkles across your forehead. The inner <em>(medial)</em> and outer <em>(lateral)</em>  parts of the frontalis muscle can function independently, which is why some  people can raise one eyebrow and not the other. The procerus muscle runs from  your nasal bone and cartilage at the side of your nose and fans upward to the  center of your forehead. This muscle pulls the skin at the center of your  forehead down, forming transverse wrinkles in the glabellas region and bridge  of your nose.</p>
                        <h3>Frequently asked questions?</h3>
                        <h4>How  is a brow lift Performed? </h4>
                        <p>There are  many types of brow lift surgery. The decision on which brow lift is right for  you is based on your facial anatomy, aesthetic goals and your surgeon's opinion  and style.</p>
                        <p>Brow lifts  are usually done on an outpatient basis and take between one to two hours to  complete. They can be performed in a hospital, in a freestanding surgical  clinic or in a surgical suite in a surgeon's office. Brow lifts can be done in  conjunction with a face lift, eyelid surgery or other cosmetic surgery.  Combining facial plastic surgery procedures will increase your time in surgery  and your risks, but it may help offset certain costs.</p>
                        <p>Most brow  lift procedures are performed with local anesthesia and light sleep sedation,  but general anesthesia may also be an option. During your brow lift, your blood  pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels should be closely monitored. You  may be given an oral sedative an hour or so before your surgery to calm your  nerves. Usually, you will have an intravenous <em>(IV)</em> line inserted into a vein in  your arm or hand to administer fluids and other drugs, including anesthesia.</p>
                        <p>Your hair  will be gathered into sections using small rubber bands or clips. Your surgeon  begins by making the incisions. Incision length and placement depends on the  type of brow lift you are having. The good news is that scarring after brow  lift surgery is usually minimal, and any scars are hidden within your hairline  or easily covered if you comb your hair forward.</p>
                        <p>Your surgeon  dissects your skin and the muscles of your forehead. He or she will remove  excess, loose skin and excess fat in the brow line, and may rearrange the  muscles of your forehead. The surgeon will then lift your brow skin to its new  position and close the incision with sutures or staples. Lastly, he or she will  apply a dressing to your face and head to protect the incisions and encourage  proper healing. This dressing may run from around the top of your head to under  your chin.</p>
                        <h2>Procedure</h2>
                        <p>Following  are some of the different procedural options to improve the drooping brow line.</p>
                        <h3>Coronal  lift</h3>
                        <p>This type of brow lift involves making an incision at the hairline in which the  excess skin is removed and the skin that remains is sutured. It is not  recommended to people who have a receding hair because it can leave a visible  scar at the hairline.</p>
                        <h3>Transblepharoplasty</h3>
                        <p>In this procedure  the incisions made during the eyelid surgery are utilized. Since both the  treatments can be provided during the same session, many people choose to have  both done at the same time so as to minimize scarring. In this type of brow  lift, stitches or the insertion of a fixation device are required so that the  shape remains intact.</p>
                        <h3>Endoscopic  technique</h3>
                        <p>In this method, several small incisions are made to limit the scarring that  occurs as a result of the brow lift surgery. Some surgeons may insert a  material inside to help the forehead hold its shape. This material dissolves  with passage of time.</p>
                        <h2>Alternatives</h2>
                        <p>There are no real  alternatives to an eyebrow lift. Wrinkling of the forehead itself may be  improved by the use of Botox injections but this does not promote elevation of  the eyebrows and may cause further drooping of the eyebrows.</p>
                        <h3>Botox,  the non-surgical alternative</h3>
                        <p>For people who do not like to go for a  surgical brow lift procedure, there is another way of achieving the similar  results. It is done by utilizing a cosmetic injection which will tighten the  forehead area and smooth out the skin. The injection usually lasts for a few  months and after that you will need to revisit your doctor.</p>
                        <h2>After surgery care</h2>
                        <h3>At   hospital</h3>
                        <p>Following  the surgery the extent of the bandaging will depend on how the surgery has been  performed and if it has been performed in conjunction with any other procedures  to make your face look younger.</p>
                        <p>If it has  been performed using endoscopic techniques there will be small scars above the  hairline. There may also be small scars in the forehead area. </p>
                        <p>You may have  bandages pressed firmly over your forehead which can decrease the amount of  bleeding underneath the skin in the post-operative period.</p>
                        <p>If the  surgery has been performed using a bigger scar, there is likely to be firm  bandaging over your scalp and forehead area.</p>
                        <p>It is also  likely that you will have bruising and swelling particularly to your upper  eyelid area and that there may be altered sensation and decreased feeling over  the forehead and scalp areas. This unusual feeling is likely to improve as time  progresses. </p>
                        <p>Occasionally  it may be necessary to have drains <em>(fine plastic tubes placed in the area  you&rsquo;ve been operated on that come out through your skin and drain into a bag)</em>.  These are to remove any residual blood or other fluid from the area of the  operation. They usually come out two to three days after the operation. This is  very easy to do and should not hurt.</p>
                        <p>The nurse  will check you blood pressure, pulse and temperature on a regular basis. It is  also likely that you will be asked to keep upright, avoid coughing, stooping  and straining. The area you&rsquo;ve been operated on will feel uncomfortable and  possibly painful. You will be given painkillers to help with this. </p>
                        <h3>At Home</h3>
                        <p>The unusual  sensation over the forehead and scalp area can persist for many weeks following  surgery and may feel numb and occasionally itchy. It is important to remember  to avoid any heavy lifting or straining activities.</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>You should  not smoke; take alcohol or Aspirin for at least two weeks following surgery.</li>
                          <li>Continuing  to sleep in a semi-upright position or with your head propped up with a number  of pillows helps to minimize swelling. </li>
                          <li>On the third  or fourth day following surgery, the hair can be washed. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Stitches are  generally removed between four and seven days following surgery depending on  the type of sutures that have been used. Your surgeon may use dissolving  sutures and these do not require removal and often come out with normal hair  washing. </p>
                        <h2>Possible risks</h2>
                        <ul>
                          <li>local       bruising and swelling</li>
                          <li>blurred       vision from dry eyes or ointment</li>
                          <li>asymmetry       of brow height</li>
                          <li>gradual       reversal of effect, requiring further surgery</li>
                          <li>loss       of sensation on the forehead, temporary or permanent</li>
                          <li>facial       nerve paralysis causing facial nerve weakness</li>
                          <li>loss       of hair at the incision sites</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Benefits </h2>
                        <p>Eyebrow  shape and position can make an important difference to how you look. A brow  lift procedure will raise sagging eyebrows to make your eyes appear more open,  as well as removing loose skin in the forehead to reduce the appearance of  lines and wrinkles.</p>
                    <p>A simple  brow lift procedure can help you on both fronts, making you look significantly  younger and more refreshed. This procedure can also give you a huge boost in  self-esteem and self-confidence by making you feel better about how you look.</p>
