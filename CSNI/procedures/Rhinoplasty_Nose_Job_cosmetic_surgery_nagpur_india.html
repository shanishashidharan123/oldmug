          <p>Rhinoplasty, which comes from  the Greek word Rhinos, meaning &ldquo;nose&rdquo;, and Plassein, meaning &ldquo;to shape&rdquo;, is a  procedure that uses surgery to improve, enhance, or fix the function or the  appearance of the nose. Commonly called a &ldquo;nose job&rdquo;, rhinoplasty is one of  the most popular plastic  surgery procedures in the country today, and is offered as a  standard in many of the major clinics all over the world.</p>
          <p>But it is also one of  the oldest, with some of the first cases of rhinoplasty dating back over 500 BC, in  India. In fact, one technique performed today in rhinoplasty that uses  the forehead flap has actually been developed in this time period, and has  almost been unchanged since then. Over the centuries, certain methods and  techniques have been used in different cases all over the world, eventually  making the foundation of modern rhinoplasty  practiced today.</p>
          <p>Rhinoplasty can serve both  practical and cosmetic purposes.  Reconstructive  rhinoplasty is used to improve the nose&rsquo;s function, such as  removing excess tissue blocking the nostrils, restoring the shape of the nose  after severe physical trauma, or fixing, or even creating a nose if a birth  defect has damaged or prevented the formation of the nose.</p>
          <p>Cosmetic rhinoplasty is performed to  solely fix, enhance, restore, or completely change the appearance of the nose.  This is done to make the nose more symmetrical, fix any bumps or unwanted lines  in the skin, enlarge or reduce it depending on the face&rsquo;s proportions, to make  it sharper or rounder, or for any other cosmetic reason.</p>
          <h2>Candidacy</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Patients  who wish to diminish the appearance of bumps on their nose.</li>
            <li>Patients  who have dents, hollowness or indentations, or have noses which look  asymmetric.</li>
            <li>Patients  who have a flat nasal bridge, and wish to create a bridge or augment their  original bridge. This is a very common request in the Asian and African  American population.</li>
            <li>Patients  with droopy tips or downward appearing tips who wish to raise the tip of the  nose.</li>
            <li>Patients  who have had surgical nose jobs in the past and are unhappy with the appearance  of their noses.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Lastly there  are those people who are not 100% emotionally and physically ready to undergo  surgery and want to take the idea of a new nose for a &ldquo;test run&rdquo;. They can do  this procedure to decide if a nose job is right for them to begin with.</p>
          <p>Rhinoplasty is commonly performed in  order to correct many problems, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the       size of the nose</li>
            <li>the       shape of the tip </li>
            <li>the       shape of the bridge</li>
            <li>the       span of the nostrils</li>
            <li>the       angle between the nose and upper lip</li>
            <li>birth       defects</li>
            <li>upper       respiratory problems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are two widely-used procedures  for rhinoplasty, and each is detailed below:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Closed rhinoplasty: For minor reshaping or other minimal changes, many surgeons will make incisions  within the nose. The skin of the nose is then separated from the bone and  cartilage, forming its supporting framework. Once exposed, bone and cartilage  can be removed, reshaped, augmented, or rearranged to achieve the desired new  shape.</li>
            <li>Open rhinoplasty: This is a more complicated procedure that&rsquo;s used for making major changes to  the nose. For instance, in an open rhinoplasty, incisions are cut along the  vertical strip of skin that separates the nostrils. This vertical strip is  known as the &ldquo;columella,&rdquo; and this surgery generally takes longer to complete  and carries a longer recovery time.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Frequently asked questions?</h3>
          <h4>What  should I do if I want my nose rebuilt?</h4>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re thinking of having your nose re-shaped, the first thing you need to  do is contact a cosmetic surgeon for a full consultation. During that meeting,  the doctor will not only more than provide enough information to answer the  question, &ldquo;What is rhinoplasty?&rdquo;, but he or she will also perform careful  analysis of your nose and overall facial structure.</p>
          <p>After the  analysis is complete, the cosmetic surgeon will discuss all the possibilities  with you, including whether an open or closed rhinoplasty would fit best with  your situation. Many cosmetic surgeons will even be able to show you visually  what you can expect after a successful procedure so that you can make a  completely informed decision. Every surgical decision needs to be made after  carefully considering every relevant factor, and this consultation will serve  that purpose. If you&rsquo;re ready to take control of your look and boost your  confidence, contact a cosmetic surgeon today.</p>
          <h2>Rhinoplasty - nose job specifics</h2>
          <p>As you prepare for a rhinoplasty, you need to make sure to  gather as much information as possible in order to proceed without stress and  uncertainty. Important information regarding any surgery includes how to  prepare for the procedure, how to recover from the procedure, and how the  procedure is done. Two common questions in regards to the specifics of  rhinoplasty are, &ldquo;Where are incisions placed for a rhinoplasty?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What are  some variations to the common rhinoplasty method?&rdquo; Each of these questions is  answered below, but for more specific information, contact a cosmetic surgeon  today.</p>
          <h3>Frequently asked questions?</h3>
          <h4>Where are incisions placed for a  rhinoplasty? </h4>
          <p>Incisions for a rhinoplasty are made in one of two  locations, depending on the degree of reconstruction the surgery will  accomplish. For instance, for more minor nose procedures, incisions are placed  inside the nose, and this prevents the scars from being outwardly visible. For  more extensive reconstruction, incisions are placed along the strip of skin  between the nostrils.</p>
          <h4>What are some variations to the  common rhinoplasty method?</h4>
          <p>There are two common methods used for rhinoplasty. There are different names  associated with each, but the most common labels are &ldquo;open&rdquo; rhinoplasty and  &ldquo;closed&rdquo; rhinoplasty.</p>
          <p>The open rhinoplasty is the more extensive of the two  procedures, and this surgery involves major reconstruction of the nose. The  surgeon will cut incisions along the strip of skin between the nostrils, the  nasal cavity is opened and the nose is completely reshaped.</p>
          <p>The closed rhinoplasty is minor relative to the open  procedure, and this surgery involves incisions being placed inside the nose for  the purpose of adjusting or reducing the nose&rsquo;s size and shape.</p>
          <p>Overall, patients tend to come to a decision regarding  whether or not to move forward with a rhinoplasty based on answers to several  questions. Two of the most common questions regarding the procedure itself are,  &ldquo;Where are incisions placed for a rhinoplasty?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What are some variations  to the common rhinoplasty method?&rdquo; These answers are provided, but for a more  specific and individually-tailored analysis, you need to contact a cosmetic  surgeon for a consultation.</p>
          <p>During this consultation, the cosmetic surgeon will closely  examine your nose and overall facial structure, explain the entire process to  you and even show you how you&rsquo;ll look after the procedure so that your  expectations are properly set. It&rsquo;s time to take control of your life and your  self image - contact a cosmetic surgeon today.</p>
          <h2>Rhinoplasty preparation</h2>
          <p>As you prepare for your rhinoplasty, you need to gather as  much information in regards to the procedure as possible. The best way to do so  is to have all of your questions answered. Three of the most common questions  patients have in regards to getting ready for rhinoplasty are answered here,  and they are, &ldquo;What are some of the risks associated with rhinoplasty?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What  steps should I take to prepare for surgery?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What can I expect the day of  surgery to be like?&rdquo; However, if you have other questions or would like more  specific information as it relates to your situation, please contact a cosmetic  surgeon for a consultation.</p>
          <h3>Frequently asked questions?</h3>
          <h4>What are some of the risks  associated with rhinoplasty?</h4>
          <p>Generally speaking, risks associated with rhinoplasty are minimal. These risks include  those that are part of any surgery, including an infection and a negative  reaction to anesthesia. Specific rhinoplasty risks include the rare appearance  of tiny red spots on the nose that are permanent in nature. Otherwise,  rhinoplasty comes with very little, if any, visible scarring.</p>
          <h4>What steps should I take to prepare  for surgery?</h4>
          <p>Preparatory steps for rhinoplasty will come from your surgeon. Generally, these  recommended steps include guidelines regarding your diet, what you drink,  smoking, the ingestion of vitamins, sleep and even washing your face. In order  to minimize the recovery time needed from this procedure, you need to be sure  to follow these guidelines exactly, as they will only speed up the process of  your return to your normal routine.</p>
          <h4>What can I expect the day of surgery  to be like?</h4>
          <p>In regards to emotions, you&rsquo;ll most likely feel a mixture of excitement,  nervousness and even a bit of fear, but that&rsquo;s quite normal, as any patient  naturally feels some anxiety before surgery. After your procedure is complete,  you&rsquo;ll most likely be sent home to begin the process of recovery.</p>
          <p>Overall, three of the most common questions patients ask  are, &ldquo;What are some of the risks associated with rhinoplasty?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What steps  should I take to prepare for surgery?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What can I expect the day of  surgery to be like?&rdquo; These questions are answered in a general sense above, but  if you&rsquo;d like more specific information, or you have other questions, the best  source of information is an experienced cosmetic surgeon.</p>
          <p>If you contact a facial plastics cosmetic surgeon for a  consultation, he or she will explain the steps included in the procedure, how  you should prepare and what you can expect in terms of results. It&rsquo;s time to  take charge of your life and to give yourself a new look - contact a facial  plastic cosmetic surgeon today.</p>
          <h2>Rhinoplasty - nose job recovery</h2>
          <p>When it comes to any form of surgery, the best way to  prepare is to gather all of the information that&rsquo;s relevant to your situation.  This information gathering involves understanding the preparation for a  procedure, the specifics of the procedure itself and the knowledge surrounding  proper recovery. In terms of recovery, three common patient questions include,  &ldquo;How will I look and feel immediately following the surgery?&rdquo;, &ldquo;When can I  pursue my normal activities again?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How long can I expect results to  last?&rdquo; Each of these questions is answered below, but for more specific  information, contact a cosmetic surgeon for a consultation.</p>
          <h3>Frequently asked questions?</h3>
          <h4>How will I look and feel immediately  following the surgery?</h4>
          <p>Specifically, you&rsquo;ll feel sore after surgery. Your face will be swollen, and  you may experience a dull headache. However, your pain and discomfort can  easily be managed with medications. Your face will continue to swell for a few  days after the procedure is complete, and you&rsquo;ll notice some level of  discomfort during that time. However, this is completely normal, and all a part  of the healing process.</p>
          <h4>When can I pursue my normal  activities again?</h4>
          <p>The process of returning to your normal activities occurs in stages. In terms  of just getting back on your feet, that should occur within a couple of days,  and you should be able to return to work within a week. However, other  activities need to stop for a few weeks, including anything that&rsquo;s physically  strenuous in nature. Your face needs time to heal, and avoiding stress to the  affected area is critical to your overall recovery.</p>
          <h4>How long can I expect results to  last?</h4>
          <p>After the effects of the surgery have passed, you can expect your new nose to  provide you with a new look for many years. The nose is not generally an area  of the face that changes with time, which means that a rhinoplasty can be seen  as a permanent solution in almost every case, with a very small number of  exceptions.</p>
          <p>Overall, three very common questions regarding the recovery  from rhinoplasty are, &ldquo;How will I look and feel immediately following the  surgery?&rdquo;, &ldquo;When can I pursue my normal activities again?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How long can I  expect results to last?&rdquo;. Although general guidelines are provided above, no two  noses are exactly alike, which is why you should contact an experienced  cosmetic surgeon for an individualized analysis of your overall situation.</p>
          <p>Your cosmetic surgeon will be able to examine your nose and  face and provide you with a visual representation of what you can expect from  rhinoplasty. These results can vary depending on what you want, and the  recovery time and specifics can differ somewhat based on your medical history  and facial structure. Regardless, if you&rsquo;re ready to take charge of your look,  the first step is contacting a cosmetic surgeon for a full consultation.</p>
          <h2>Benefits of  rhinoplasty</h2>
          <p>The benefits  of rhinoplasty can be enormous! When we improve our physical appearance, we  tend to feel more confident, whether in social interactions or career paths,  and this is true of both males and females. Rhinoplasty can improve a person's  overall look and how they are also perceived by others to give a stronger  confidence.</p>
          <h2>Side effects</h2>
          <p>Although  rhinoplasty is relatively safe it does have some mild side effects. The most  common side effects are temporary bruising, numbness, swelling, and a tingling  sensation. Patients should ask their doctors about rhinoplasty side effects  that may affect their particular situation.</p>
          <h2>Risks</h2>
          <p>All medical  procedures bring risk including rhinoplasty. A good candidate for a rhinoplasty  is in good overall health and has the psychological stability to deal with the  recovery period. There is often some post-op pain or discomfort, temporary  bruising and swelling, some restriction on activity, and some work-time lost.</p>
          <p>Recovery is  straightforward when you get rhinoplasty if you follow surgeon's orders.</p>
